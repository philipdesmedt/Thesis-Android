# Collaborative Modeling Framework

This modeling framework uses the [MetaDepth](http://astreo.ii.uam.es/~jlara/metaDepth/) framework to model and generate collaborative Android applications. The following modeling components are included in the framework:

* Chat component
* Dropbox component
* Foursquare component
* Geo component
* List component
* Login component
* SMS component
* Timer component
* Twitter component

Some of these components can communicate with a server written in [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/).
